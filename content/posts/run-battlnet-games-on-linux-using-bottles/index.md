I'm not much of gamer but I do enjoy a few games such as Diablo and Hearthstone. Luckily, I can play these games on Linux, typically through Lutris. Today, I want to show you the process of getting Battle.net installed on Linux using Bottles instead of Lutris.

## Video Guide

If you would prefer a video guide, I have one availble on YouTube.

## What is Bottles?

Bottles is similar to Lutris, it is an application that makes it simple for you to run Windows applications and games on Linux. This is done using Windows prefixes (think of this as a Windows installation) and allowing you have multiple Windows environments, which are called Bottles. The Bottles application is a client to manage those Bottles or Windows Environments.

## Download Bottles

Your first step in this process is to download Bottles. The easiest method and the way I install Bottles is through Flatpak. This is also the way that the Bottles creators recommend as well.

The Flatpak version can be used on most Linux distributions and also the Steam Deck
